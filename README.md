# linguistics-analysis
This project investigates the linguistic features of machine translation and human translation.

Linguistics features.py includes basic features for translation studies, standard type-token-ratio, lexical density, mean word length, mean/medium sentence length, etc.

Text similarity.py applies gensim to calculate text similarities. It can be used to compare translation and original texts.

Translation studies often store texts in Excel as a parrel corpus, and excel_extraction.py can help extract these info from Excel and write them into TXT files.
